# Weight Goal App
A simple web app (really simple) for tracking my weight loss goals. Built mostly by claude code and tweaked slightly by me.

## Data
Data is stored in the local storage of the web browser. This app is just a plain html / javascript app (exclusively browser-side), so no
data is ever transferred to the server either. On the "Data" tab you can export and import your data if you want to migrate it between devices.
